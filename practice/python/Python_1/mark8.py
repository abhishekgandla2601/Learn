# #Strings::
# In python, anything that you enclose between single or double quotation
#marks is considered a string. A string is essentially a sequence or array 
#of textual data. Strings are used when working with Unicode characters.

#anything inside " " and ' ' is a string

#example:

name = 'Abhi' #sequence of characters

print('Hello,' +name)

apple = 'He said, "I want to eat an apple"'

print(apple)

# multiple lines of string

car = ''' He said

he wants to drive a car'''

print(car)

#indexing
name1 = 'Abhishek'

print(name1[0])
print(name1[1])
print(name1[2])
print(name1[3])
print(name1[4])
print(name1[5])
print(name1[6])
print(name1[7])
print(name1[8])# it throws an error
