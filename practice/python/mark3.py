# sequence: list and tuple

# list  - collection of different types of datatypes

#   mutable - changes

list1 = [1,2,3]
# immutable - unchange

# tuple - collections of items - cannot be changed it is immutable

# dictionary    - collections of key value pairs

dict1 = {'name' : "Abhishek", 'age': 23, }#map data

# in python everything is an object
